 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning 

Data Preprocessing
The diabetes prediction system involves loading the diabetes dataset, exploring its characteristics, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Standardization is applied to the input features, and the data is then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Various other classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, are also trained and evaluated.

Model Training and Evaluation
The SVM classifier is trained on the standardized data, and accuracy scores are calculated for both training and testing datasets. Additional classifiers are created, trained, and evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison of their performance.

Making Predictions
The trained SVM classifier is used to make predictions for new input data, showcasing the system's potential application in predicting diabetes based on relevant features.
